   <DESCRIPTION> <![CDATA[
     Clear the left pane and send obtain all instance subsystem command 
     to all processors. 
     <br /><br />
     All of the subsystem commands that are defined for instance 
     statistics are formed by pre-pending the processor ID to a 
     base subsystem command value.  The variable subsystem command 
     value is needed in order to support multiple processor 
     architectures, to ensure that the command reaches the correct 
     protocol stack instance.  In all of the following subsystem 
     commands, the processor ID is a 4-bit value (the top 4 bits of 
     the 2-byte value).

   <DESCRIPTION> <![CDATA[
      Send subsystem command with all requested instances to the 
      MSM to obtain corresponding statistics. 
      <br /><br />
      This subsystem command packet is sent by QXDM to the MSM in 
      order to request that a statistics log packet be generated
      for the log handle included in the subsystem command request
      message.  It is possible to specify multiple instances in 
      this packet, and it is necessary to pair the instance handle
      with its type since instance handles are not globally unique 
      on their own.
